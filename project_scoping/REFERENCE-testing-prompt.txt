 Plan a verification that the existing testing works both locally and in CICD. Test by making      
  commits to a PR in GitHub, and leveraging the Claude PR integration to get feedback on what       
  is working well. Keep iterating on running the tests in the GitHub Action until we get a          
  successful pipeline. This is paving the way for a deployment to AWS with terraform, which we      
  will not implement yet. We are just checking the GitHub Actions integration with Claude and       
  your ability to iterate locally using this integration at this point. Make sure the full          
  tests are passing locally and generating the TSR before going to test the GitHub Actions          
  integration.
