        <strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> What's the biggest pain point for your support team?
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>SARAH (Support Manager):</strong> We're drowning in repetitive questions. "What's your return policy?" "How much does Enterprise cost?" These are all in our docs, but customers don't want to search.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> How many of these repetitive questions do you see?
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>SARAH:</strong> About 60% of our tickets. My team spends hours answering the same questions over and over. We could be solving real problems instead.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> What would success look like?
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>SARAH:</strong> If 80% of these simple questions could be answered instantly and accurately, my team could focus on the complex issues that actually need human judgment. Speed matters too - our customers expect instant answers now.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> What concerns do you have about an AI solution?
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>SARAH:</strong> Accuracy is everything. If it gives wrong information about pricing or return policies, that's worse than slow human support. We need to be able to trust what it says.
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> How would you want to verify that trust?
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>SARAH:</strong> I'd want to see exactly where the AI is getting its information. If it's pulling from our official docs, that's trustworthy. If it's just making things up, that's a liability.
