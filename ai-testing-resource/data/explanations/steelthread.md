# Steel Thread Tests

Steel thread tests verify complete end-to-end user journeys from entry point to completion.

## What They Test
- Portfolio site loads correctly
- Navigation to deployed application works
- Core features are accessible and functional
- Error handling is graceful (no stack traces exposed)

## Why They Matter
Steel thread tests validate that all components work together in production, catching integration issues that unit tests miss.
