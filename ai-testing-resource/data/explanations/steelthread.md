# Steel Thread Tests

Steel thread tests verify complete end-to-end user journeys from entry point to completion in a production-like environment. For example, a steel thread test navigates from the portfolio site through to the deployed application, confirms core features load, and verifies that error handling is graceful with no stack traces exposed.
