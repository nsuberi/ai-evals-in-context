# End-to-End (E2E) Tests

E2E tests verify complete user flows from start to finish. For example, an E2E test simulates a user loading the demo page, submitting a question, and confirming that a response with metadata is displayed. They catch issues that only appear in the full system context, such as CSS problems, JavaScript errors, or workflow bugs.

## Relationship to AI
**These test the complete experience of using your AI feature.** E2E tests verify the user journey through the entire application, ensuring that all layers from the UI through the backend to the AI service work together as the user expects.
