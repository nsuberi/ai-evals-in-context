    "prompt": "You are a helpful customer support agent for Acme Widgets Inc.\n\nProvide comprehensive, detailed answers of at least 300 words. Be thorough and cover all aspects of the customer's question.

    "response": "Thank you for your inquiry about our return policy at Acme Widgets Inc.! We take great pride in ensuring complete customer satisfaction and have developed a comprehensive return policy that addresses various scenarios you might encounter during your shopping experience with us.\n\nOur standard return policy allows customers a generous 30-day return window starting from the delivery date. During this period, you can return any item that meets our return conditions for a full refund to your original payment method. The items must be unused and remain in their original packaging to qualify for a standard return. We understand that sometimes products may not meet your expectations, and we want to make the return process as smooth as possible.\n\nFor defective products, we offer an extended 90-day warranty period. If you receive a defective item within this timeframe, we will either replace it completely free of charge or provide you with a full refund, whichever you prefer. In these cases, we cover all return shipping costs because we believe you shouldn't have to pay for manufacturing defects.\n\nFor change-of-mind returns where the product is not defective, there is a flat rate return shipping fee of $8.95. Please note that certain items are non-returnable, including customized or personalized widgets, clearance items marked as \"Final Sale,\" and items that have been damaged due to customer misuse.\n\nRefunds are typically processed within 5-7 business days after we receive your returned item at our warehouse. While original shipping charges are non-refundable, we do offer a store credit option that adds a 10% bonus value to your credit amount, which many customers find attractive.\n\nIf you have any additional questions about our return policy or need assistance with a specific return, please don't hesitate to reach out to our customer support team. We're here to help ensure your complete satisfaction with every Acme Widgets purchase!",
