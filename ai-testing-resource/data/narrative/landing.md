## The Rituals That Build Confidence

The SDLC is not bureaucracy. It is the structure that enables fast deployment with confidence. These rituals are how experienced engineering teams have always shipped quality software. What's different now is that agentic coding tools are enabling new participants&mdash;product managers, business analysts, and domain experts&mdash;to build alongside experienced engineers.

**What we ask of you:** Bring your domain expertise. You understand the customer, the business rules, and what "good" looks like. The SDLC is not the obstacle between your code and production. It is the bridge that makes fast, confident shipping possible.

**Discovery Ritual** &mdash; Builders and business stakeholders agree on acceptance criteria *before* work begins. This is where "done" gets defined, creating alignment from Day 1.

**Test Review Ritual** &mdash; As the test suite grows, teams review what's being tested and what isn't. This surfaces gaps early and builds shared confidence between builders and approvers.

**TSR Checkpoint** &mdash; Before each release, the Test Summary Report captures what changed, what was tested, and whether results meet the agreed criteria. It's lightweight, scoped to the specific changes in that release, and provides the evidence needed for go/no-go decisions.

These rituals are not gates that slow you down. They are the structured confidence-building that unlocks fast experimentation and risk control simultaneously:

1. **Alignment from the start** &mdash; Requirements and acceptance criteria provide a shared definition of "done"
2. **Confidence as you build** &mdash; Test types provide a common language for quality between builders and approvers
3. **Predictable path to production** &mdash; The TSR checkpoint provides traceable evidence for deployment decisions
