## The Rituals That Build Confidence

Governance isn't a gate at the end of a project. It's a set of rituals that run throughout the lifecycle:

**Discovery Ritual** &mdash; Builders and business stakeholders agree on acceptance criteria *before* work begins. This is where "done" gets defined.

**Test Review Ritual** &mdash; As the test suite grows, teams review what's being tested and what isn't. This surfaces gaps early, not at the last minute.

**TSR Checkpoint** &mdash; Before each release, the Test Summary Report captures what changed, what was tested, and whether results meet the agreed criteria. It's lightweight and scoped to the specific changes in that release.

## New Builders in the SDLC

Agentic coding tools are changing who participates in the software development lifecycle. Product managers, business analysts, and domain experts who haven't coded before are now building features alongside experienced engineers.

The structured approach described here helps everyone know:

1. **What to build** &mdash; Requirements and acceptance criteria provide a shared definition of "done"
2. **How to build it correctly** &mdash; Test types provide a common language for quality
3. **How to avoid introducing new problems** &mdash; The TSR checkpoint catches regressions before they reach production
