## Why This Journey Matters

Traditional software testing verifies that code works correctly. But AI systems require a different approach - they need **evaluations** that verify the AI *behaves* correctly.

This educational journey shows you how AI evals fit alongside traditional testing in a real product development lifecycle. You'll see:

- How requirements drive acceptance criteria for AI behavior
- Where AI evals fit in the test pyramid
- How to iterate on AI behavior through evaluation cycles
- How to maintain governance and compliance for AI systems
