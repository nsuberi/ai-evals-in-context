## The Test Summary Report

The TSR is the central governance artifact. It captures what changed in a release, what was tested, and whether the results meet the acceptance criteria agreed upon during discovery.

Each TSR is scoped to a specific release, not a re-test of the entire application. This keeps the artifact lightweight and focused. The TSRs below were created through the development process you've just followed&mdash;from discovery through iteration to deployment.

The rituals that produce these artifacts&mdash;acceptance criteria agreement, test review sessions, and TSR checkpoints&mdash;are what build confidence between builders and the teams who approve their work.
