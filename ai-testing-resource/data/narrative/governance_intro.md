## The TSR Is How Your Organization Documents That the SDLC Was Followed

The Test Summary Report is the central governance artifact. It captures what changed in a release, what was tested, and whether the results meet the acceptance criteria agreed upon during discovery. This is not a new invention for AI&mdash;test summary reports have existed for decades. What's new is extending them to include AI-specific evidence: eval pass rates, failure mode taxonomies, and trace review results.

Each TSR is scoped to a specific release, not a re-test of the entire application. This keeps the artifact lightweight and focused. The TSRs below were created through the development process you've just followed&mdash;from discovery through iteration to deployment.

The rituals that produce these artifacts&mdash;acceptance criteria agreement, test review sessions, and TSR checkpoints&mdash;are what build confidence between builders and the teams who approve their work. Clear structure for how to create a TSR and how it fits into the rituals of the company is how organizations unlock fast experimentation and risk control simultaneously.
