## Maintaining Trust

Governance provides the audit trail that proves our AI system meets requirements and operates safely. It ties together:

- **Requirements** from Phase 1 (what we promised to build)
- **Test Results** from Phase 3 (proof the code works)
- **Evaluation Results** from Phase 4 (proof the AI behaves correctly)
- **Production Traces** from Phase 5 (ongoing evidence of compliance)

The TSR (Test Summary Report) system formalizes go/no-go decisions for deployments based on test results and business risk assessment.
