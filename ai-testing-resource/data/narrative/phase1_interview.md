# Stakeholder Interview

**INTERVIEWER:** What's the biggest pain point for your support team?

**SARAH (Support Manager):** We're drowning in repetitive questions. "What's your return policy?" "How much does Enterprise cost?" These are all in our docs, but customers don't want to search.

**INTERVIEWER:** How many of these repetitive questions do you see?

**SARAH:** About 60% of our tickets. My team spends hours answering the same questions over and over. We could be solving real problems instead.

**INTERVIEWER:** What would success look like?

**SARAH:** If 80% of these simple questions could be answered instantly and accurately, my team could focus on the complex issues that actually need human judgment. Speed matters too - our customers expect instant answers now.

**INTERVIEWER:** What concerns do you have about an AI solution?

**SARAH:** Accuracy is everything. If it gives wrong information about pricing or return policies, that's worse than slow human support. We need to be able to trust what it says.

**INTERVIEWER:** How would you want to verify that trust?

**SARAH:** I'd want to see exactly where the AI is getting its information. If it's pulling from our official docs, that's trustworthy. If it's just making things up, that's a liability.
