## Acme Widget Co. is losing customers.

Their support team is overwhelmed with repetitive questions:
- "What's your return policy?"
- "How much does Enterprise cost?"
- "When will my order arrive?"

These questions all have answers in their documentation, but customers don't want to search. They want instant answers.
