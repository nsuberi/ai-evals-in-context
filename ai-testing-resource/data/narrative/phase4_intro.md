## Iterating on AI Behavior

Before deploying to production, we iterate on the chatbot's behavior through multiple versions. Each version addresses issues discovered through AI evaluations.

**The Iteration Cycle:**
1. Run evaluations against current version
2. Identify failure modes (too verbose, hallucinating, etc.)
3. Adjust prompt or architecture
4. Re-run evaluations
5. Repeat until all acceptance criteria pass

Use the version selector to see how each version's responses differ. Pay attention to the annotations that highlight issues like verbosity (v1) and hallucination (v2).
