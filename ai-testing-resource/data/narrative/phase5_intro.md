## Monitoring Is How You Know It's Still Working

With v3 approved by evaluations, we deploy to production and begin continuous monitoring. This is established engineering practice&mdash;no experienced team ships a feature and walks away. What's different with AI is that you're monitoring both traditional system health *and* AI behavior quality.

**The Four-Quadrant Framework** below gives you a diagnostic tool. By tracking product engagement and AI quality together, you can distinguish between four states&mdash;each requiring a different response. A product with healthy engagement but degrading quality ("Hidden Debt") requires a very different action than one with great quality but declining usage ("Product Problem").

**Try the live demo** to interact with the actual chatbot and see the full RAG pipeline in action. Then review the monitoring framework that a production team would use to keep it healthy.

**The Feedback Loop:** Production monitoring isn't the end&mdash;it's the beginning of the next cycle. Real usage data surfaces new requirements, edge cases, and opportunities that feed back into Phase 1: Discovery.
