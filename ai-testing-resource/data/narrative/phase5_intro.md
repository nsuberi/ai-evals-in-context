## Continuous Monitoring

With v3 approved by evaluations, we deploy to production and begin continuous monitoring. The live demo below lets you interact with the actual chatbot and see the full RAG pipeline in action.

**Try It Yourself:**
1. Ask a question about Acme Widgets (pricing, returns, shipping, products)
2. Expand the "Knowledge Base Pipeline" to see the RAG trace
3. Compare versions to see how prompt engineering and architecture affect responses

**The Feedback Loop:**
Production monitoring isn't the end - it's the beginning of the next cycle. Real usage data surfaces new requirements, edge cases, and opportunities for improvement that feed back into Phase 1: Discovery.
