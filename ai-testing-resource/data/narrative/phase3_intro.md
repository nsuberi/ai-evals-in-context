## The Test Types You Need to Know

This is the vocabulary of quality assurance. Senior engineers have used these test types for decades to ship reliable software. The testing pyramid is not new&mdash;what's new is extending it to cover AI behavior.

**Each test type below has a specific job.** Some catch bugs in individual functions. Others verify that the full system works end-to-end. And the newest ones&mdash;AI acceptance tests and evals&mdash;assess whether the AI behaves the way stakeholders agreed it should.

You don't need to write these tests yourself. But you need to understand what each one does, who creates it, and what role it plays in the TSR. This is the shared language that builders, reviewers, and governance teams use to communicate about quality.
