## Building with Tests

In this phase, we implement the chatbot and build a comprehensive test suite. The Test Navigator below lets you explore different types of tests:

**Traditional Tests (SDLC)**
- **Unit Tests**: Verify individual functions like input sanitization and token counting
- **Integration Tests**: Verify the RAG pipeline works end-to-end
- **E2E Tests**: Verify the full user journey from question to answer

**AI Acceptance Tests**
- **Grounding Tests**: Verify responses cite the knowledge base
- **Accuracy Tests**: Verify responses contain correct information
- **Format Tests**: Verify responses meet length and style requirements
