    "# AI Evaluation Workshop: Building Trust in Automated Judgment\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook teaches you to build, validate, and monitor AI evaluation pipelines using a mortgage lending assistant as our running example. By the end, you'll have a framework for answering the question every stakeholder asks: **\"How do we know the AI is doing a good job?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** Governance is an accelerator, not a gate. Confidence in automated evaluation comes from systematically comparing machine judgment against human judgment.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Regulatorily problematic** — making promises or guarantees about approval\n",
    "- **Missing disclaimers** — quoting rates without noting they're estimates\n",
    "- **Vague and unactionable** — technically correct but useless to the borrower\n",
    "- **Tonally inappropriate** — too casual for compliance, too stiff for customer service\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Synthetic data** (where you are now) — validate the evaluation framework itself\n",
    "2. **Anonymized traces** — capture real interactions with PII stripped, use for evaluation\n",
    "3. **Aggregate metrics** — track scores over time without storing individual responses\n",
    "4. **Graduated rollout** — use evaluation gates to control which model versions reach production\n",
